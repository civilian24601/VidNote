# Software Blueprint Intake

## Project Overview
A web platform for music students to upload performance videos and receive timestamped feedback from teachers. This educational tool aims to enhance remote music instruction by facilitating detailed feedback on specific moments in student performances.

## Core Problem Statement
Traditional music education struggles with asynchronous learning and providing specific, time-referenced feedback. Students need a way to receive detailed guidance on particular sections of their performances, and teachers need tools to efficiently deliver targeted instruction.

## Target Users
1. **Music Students**: Learning instruments or voice through formal instruction
2. **Music Teachers**: Professional instructors providing feedback and guidance
3. **Music Schools/Conservatories**: Institutions looking to enhance their remote teaching capabilities

## Essential Features
- User authentication with student/teacher roles
- Video upload and storage system
- Video player with precise timestamp controls
- Comment system attached to specific timestamps
- Teacher dashboard to manage students and feedback
- Student progress tracking and performance history
- Ability to share videos with specific teachers
- Mobile responsiveness for on-the-go review

## Technical Requirements
- Secure user authentication and role management
- Robust video storage and delivery system
- Real-time or near-real-time commenting
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Appropriate data security measures for educational content
- Scalable backend to handle growing user base and video storage

## Success Metrics
- Improved student practice habits (measured by performance uploads)
- More specific feedback from teachers (measured by timestamp precision)
- Reduced time between practice and feedback (compared to traditional methods)
- Student performance improvement over time (through video comparisons)
- Teacher satisfaction with feedback tools (through surveys)

## Timeline and Constraints
- Initial MVP delivered within 2-3 months
- Phased approach with core video and feedback functionality first
- Analytics and advanced features in later phases
- Budget constraints require cost-effective cloud services

## Integration Requirements
- Potential integration with common learning management systems
- Possible future APIs for music schools to integrate with their systems
- Consideration for video conferencing integration for live sessions

## Special Considerations
- Accessibility for users with disabilities
- FERPA compliance for educational data
- Bandwidth considerations for users with limited internet access
- Cross-platform compatibility
