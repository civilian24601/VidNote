# Test Plan

## Testing Philosophy

The testing strategy for the Music Education Platform follows a comprehensive approach that ensures reliability, performance, and accessibility across all application components. Our testing philosophy emphasizes:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests before implementing features
2. **Continuous Testing**: Running tests automatically on every commit
3. **Coverage-Driven Quality**: Using coverage metrics to identify untested code
4. **User-Centric Testing**: Focusing on real user workflows and scenarios
5. **Accessibility by Default**: Making accessibility testing a core requirement

## Testing Types and Scope

### Unit Testing

**Coverage Target: 80% code coverage**

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components and functions in isolation. These tests are the foundation of our testing pyramid and ensure that each building block works as expected.

   - Test each React component in isolation
   - Verify rendering with different props
   - Test component state changes
   - Validate event handlers

2. **Hook Tests**:
   - Verify custom hooks functionality
   - Test state management and updates
   - Validate side effects

3. **Utility Function Tests**:
   - Test pure functions
   - Validate data transformations
   - Verify helper functions

#### Backend Unit Tests:

1. **Route Handler Tests**:
   - Test API endpoint handlers
   - Verify request validation
   - Test error handling

2. **Service Tests**:

- Determine maximum capacity

#### Network Resilience:
- Test with throttled network conditions
- Verify offline capabilities
- Measure performance with high latency

### Accessibility Testing

**Compliance Target: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**

Accessibility testing ensures that the application is usable by people with disabilities. These tests verify compliance with accessibility standards and best practices.

#### Automated Accessibility Tests:
- Run axe-core on all pages
- Verify HTML semantics
- Test keyboard navigation
- Check color contrast ratios

#### Manual Accessibility Tests:
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Focus management
- Alternative text verification

### Security Testing

**Security Standards: OWASP Top 10 compliance**

Security testing identifies vulnerabilities and ensures that the application protects user data and prevents unauthorized access.

#### Vulnerability Scanning:
- Run automated security scanners
- Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Verify secure HTTP headers

#### Penetration Testing:
- Test authentication mechanisms
- Attempt common attack vectors
- Verify authorization checks

#### Data Protection Tests:
- Verify encryption of sensitive data
- Test secure storage of credentials
- Validate secure API communication
