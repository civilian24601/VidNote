I'll review the application flow and identify key execution points in the codebase. Let me start by understanding the core flows from the AppFlow document.

Based on my review of the AppFlow and codebase, I can now provide a comprehensive overview of the core user flows and their current implementation status. Let me analyze the critical workflow points:

## Overview of Core User Flows and Implementation Status

### 1. Authentication Flow
**Implementation Status:** ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE
- User registration with email/password
- User login with email/password
- Session persistence
- User profile management
- Role-based access control (student vs teacher)

**Key Components:**
- `auth-context.tsx` - Recently optimized authentication system
- `login.tsx`, `register.tsx` - Login and registration pages
- `ProtectedRoute` and `TeacherRoute` in `App.tsx` - Route protection based on auth status

### 2. Video Upload Flow
**Implementation Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- Basic UI for video upload in `videos.tsx`
- Form for title, description, and file selection
- Video processing functionality placeholder
- Retry logic for uploads
- Missing: Backend implementation for storage

**Key Components:**
- `videos.tsx` - Upload dialog and form
- Missing actual connection to Supabase storage for video processing

### 3. Personal Video Library
**Implementation Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- UI for displaying user videos
- Grid view with video thumbnails
- Missing: Actual video fetching from backend
- Missing: Video sorting and filtering

**Key Components:**
- `videos.tsx` - Video grid display
- Placeholder for video data

### 4. Video Playback & Feedback
**Implementation Status:** ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE
- Enhanced video player with commenting capability
- Timeline with comment markers
- Support for teacher feedback
- Comment categorization

**Key Components:**
- `enhanced-video-player.tsx` - Custom video player with commenting
- `categorized-comments.tsx` - Comment display and management
- `teacher-feedback.tsx` - Teacher feedback UI

### 5. Video Sharing
**Implementation Status:** ❌ MINIMAL IMPLEMENTATION
- Basic UI for displaying shared videos
- Missing: Actual functionality to share videos with teachers
- Missing: Implementation of permission handling

**Key Components:**
- `shared.tsx` - Page to view shared videos
- References to sharing functionality in UI but not fully implemented

### 6. Teacher Review Flow
**Implementation Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- Teacher feedback UI components exist
- Support for categorizing feedback
- Missing: Actual connection between teachers and students
- Missing: Implementation of review workflow

**Key Components:**
- `teacher-feedback.tsx` - UI for teacher feedback
- `feedback-export.tsx` - Export functionality for feedback

### 7. Analytics/Dashboard
**Implementation Status:** ❓ UNKNOWN/MINIMAL
- Basic page exists but implementation details unclear
- Missing: Actual analytics data and visualization

**Key Components:**
- `analytics.tsx` - Page exists but implementation not clear

## Critical Execution Points Needing Attention

Based on analysis of the codebase and the AppFlow document, here are the critical points that need immediate attention:

1. **Video Upload Implementation** - The most critical gap is the actual video upload to Supabase storage:
   - Need to implement `uploadVideo` function in `videos.tsx`
   - Need to configure proper storage bucket and permissions in Supabase
   - Missing connection to backend for video processing

2. **Video Sharing Mechanism** - This is a core functionality:
   - Need to implement the teacher selection UI for sharing
   - Need to implement backend for sharing permissions
   - Missing actual sharing database operations

3. **Teacher-Student Connections** - No implementation for:
   - How teachers connect with students
   - How students find teachers to share with
   - Permissions for who can view whose videos

4. **Feedback System Completion** - While components exist:
   - Need to connect comments to specific timestamps
   - Need to implement notification for new feedback
   - Missing reply functionality for comments

5. **User Profile Management** - While auth works:
   - Need to complete profile setup flow
   - Need to implement instrument selection
   - Missing experience level tracking

6. **Data Fetching Logic** - Most pages have UI but:
   - Need to implement actual data fetching from Supabase
   - Need proper error handling and loading states
   - Missing pagination for video lists

## Recommendations for Next Steps

Based on the AppFlow and implementation gaps, I recommend focusing on these areas in this order:

1. **Complete Video Upload Pipeline** - This is fundamental to the app's functionality
2. **Implement Video Sharing Mechanism** - This enables the teacher-student interaction
3. **Build Teacher Review Workflow** - This completes the feedback loop
4. **Enhance Profile Management** - This improves user experience and app personalization
5. **Add Analytics** - This provides value through insights once the core functionality works

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect of these workflows or help implement any specific part of the missing functionality?
