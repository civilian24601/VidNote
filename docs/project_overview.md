# Music Education Platform - Project Overview

## Introduction

The Music Education Platform is a web application designed to enhance music education by facilitating interaction between students and teachers through video sharing with timestamped feedback capabilities. This platform enables music students to upload practice videos and receive detailed, time-specific feedback from their instructors.

## Purpose

Traditional music education faces challenges with asynchronous learning and detailed feedback. This platform addresses these issues by:

1. Allowing students to record and upload their practice sessions
2. Enabling teachers to provide feedback at specific timestamps in the video
3. Creating a structured repository of performance history for tracking progress
4. Facilitating better communication between teachers and students

## Core Features

### Current Implementation

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system
- **Video Upload**: Ability for students to upload practice videos
- **Video Playback**: High-quality video player with scrubbing capabilities
- **Timestamped Comments**: Teachers can leave comments at specific points in a video
- **Video Sharing**: Students can share videos with specific teachers
- **Comment System**: Threaded discussions around specific performance aspects

### Planned Features

- **Teacher Dashboard**: Specialized interface for managing multiple students
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track student practice trends and improvement
- **Collaborative Feedback**: Multiple teachers can provide feedback on the same video
- **Practice Recommendations**: AI-assisted practice recommendation system
- **Mobile Application**: Native mobile apps for iOS and Android

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built using modern web technologies:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, utilizing TanStack Query for data fetching
- **UI Components**: Custom components built with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (planned), currently using in-memory storage for development
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Media Storage**: Supabase Storage for video files
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization for consistent deployment

## User Roles

1. **Students**:
   - Upload practice videos
   - Receive feedback from teachers
   - Track progress over time
   - Share videos with specific teachers

2. **Teachers**:
   - Review student videos
   - Provide timestamped feedback
   - Track student progress
   - Assign practice exercises

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Prototype (Current)
- Basic video upload and playback
- Comment system with timestamps
- User authentication
- Video sharing capabilities

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Teacher dashboard for student management
- Analytics for tracking student practice trends
